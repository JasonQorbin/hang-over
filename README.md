## Gameplay instructions

On first start-up the application will load the dictionary into memory. Once that's done the game screen
will appear and you can play by clicking the letters on the screen to guess the word.

You are allowed 12 incorrect guesses before you official *lose* the level because dictionary being used is
quite extensive and a lot of words will come up that are not commonplace making the game quite difficult.
